        <h1>Service items and billing</h1>
        <p>Track your time by adding time entries to a ticket. Complete the ticket and create a new billing batch when you are ready to bill your customer. Tickets are grouped by customer and service item when creating a billing batch. Select one or more service items to add it to the batch to bill for all completed tickets under those service item. Create multiple tickets for any service item and bill them all at once in a single billing batch. </p>

        <h2>Hourly retainer</h2>
        <p>Hourly retainer service items generate a block of hours for your customer to use over the course of a month, quarter, or an entire year. Customers pay for the entire block of hours at the start of the billing period, and hours are deducted from the retainer as you open tickets and track time. Send an invoice each month for a new block of hours, and charge an separate rate for overage if your customer exceeds their allotted hours. </p>

            <li>Select Service items &gt; Add a New Service Item &gt; Hour Retainer.<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPMScreenshots/HourlyRetainer.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;width: 250px;height: 242px;" /><br /><br /></li>
            <li>Select a Retainer Period - this determines how often hours will accrue for billing and reporting purposes, and also when a new block of hours gets created.</li>
            <li>Select a Period Grouping option - this allows you to group together billing periods to share hours. <ol><li>For example, a 10 hour monthly retainer creates a block of 10 hours for your customer every month.</li><li>Select Quarterly as the period grouping option to share the hours over the entire quarter (30 hours over 3 months). The customer can use up to 30 hours anytime during the quarter without being charged an overage rate.</li><li>Your customer still receives an invoice each month for 10 hours, and overage is incurred if they exceed 30 hours before the end of the quarter.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Specify a Retainer Amount, and Retainer Hours.<br /></li>
            <p class="info">This automatically calculates the Base Rate of the retainer. For example: $1000 Retainer Amount and 10 Retainer Hours generates a $100 Base Rate. </p>
            <li>Specify an Overage Rate - this is the hourly rate your customer is billed if they exceed their retainer hours. </li>

        <h2>Money retainer</h2>
        <p>Create a money retainer service item to generate a block of money you can deduct from as you open tickets over the course of a billing period. Choose to bill your customer up front, before beginning work, or after tickets have been completed. A money retainer is a great way to keep your customers on a budget. After the money retainer is used up, you can generate another block of money  and send your customer a bill before doing anymore work. Continue opening tickets and tracking time after your customer pays for another retainer. </p>

It appears as a separate line item on your customer's invoice if they exceed $4,500 before the end of the quarter. </li></ol><p class="info">With no period grouping set, overage is automatically applied if your customer exceeds their retainer amount during the specified retainer period. </p></li>
            <li>Select a Default Rate, and choose additional hourly rates if needed. These will all be available when adding time entries to tickets.</li>

        <h2>Flat fee</h2>
        <p>Flat fee service items are used for recurring managed services, like server monitoring or monthly anti-virus support.  Charge your customers a fixed price multiplied by the number of supported devices in their network. For instance, you charge $50 per server for monthly monitoring and your customer has 6 servers on their network. Using a flat fee service item, <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> automatically creates a monthly bill of $300, without opening any tickets. </p>

            <li>Select an Additional Rate or use Add New Rate to create a new one. </li>
            <p class="info">Flat fee service items have a default rate of $0 to use when creating tickets for issues included in the scope of support. They are an all you can eat type of contract - your customer pays a monthly fee for monitoring and supporting devices in their network, which includes different types of support. Add an hourly rate to the service item to use when opening tickets for anything not included in the scope of support, like after hours emergency support, for instance. </p>
