        <h1>Schedule recurring tickets and appointments</h1>
        <p>Create a schedule and add recurring tickets and appointments for your customers. Use recurring tickets to track time  for monthly proactive maintenance, or regular tasks your technicians need to complete. Tickets are automatically created based on the recurrence frequency, and notifications alert employees when a new ticket has been assigned to them. </p>
