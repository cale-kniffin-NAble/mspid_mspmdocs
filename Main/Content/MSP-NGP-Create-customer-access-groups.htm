        <h1>Create customer access groups</h1>
        <p>Use Customer Access Groups to limit technician access to selected customers. Create unique groups of customers, and apply those groups to one or more technicians, giving them explicit access to only that group of customers. All customers not included in the list are hidden from the selected users. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to Settings &gt; User Management &gt; Access Groups &gt; Add Access Group.</li>
            <li>Enter a name and description, and select Enabled. </li>
            <li>Select one or more assigned customers.</li>
            <li>Select one or more assigned users. </li>
            <li>Save Access Group.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The selected users have access to the assigned customers, and can not view any other customers. </p>
