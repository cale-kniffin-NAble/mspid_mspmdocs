        <h1>Bill for partially complete tickets</h1>
        <h3>When you need to bill a customer for a job that is taking longer than expected, you are no longer required to  complete the ticket prior to billing. Send invoices for completed time and accumulated expense items without closing the ticket.  Track your time in a ticket using an hourly service item, and send your customer an invoice  for all completed time entries, and attached expense items, without closing or marking the ticket as complete. </h3>
        <h3>&#160;</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a customer.</li>
            <li>Click Service Items &gt;<a href="MSP-Charge-for-your-work-with-service-items.htm"> Create a new hourly service item</a>. </li>
            <p class="info">Partial billing is only available for hourly service items.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the service item editor, select the Partial Billing check box. </li>
            <li>Enter the required information, and save the service item.</li>
            <li>Select Tickets.</li>
            <li>Click Add a New Ticket &gt;&#160;Enter a ticket title and confirm the new hourly service item is selected. </li>
            <li>Add time entries or expenses to the ticket and save your changes. </li>
            <li><a href="MSP-Run-a-billing-batch.htm">Create and run a new billing batch</a>, and select the hourly service items for which partial billing is enabled.</li>
            <li>Generate invoices for the completed time entries in the associated ticket. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The ticket remains open, and the billed time entries are marked as billed within the ticket. Continue adding time entries to the same ticket, and repeat this process anytime you want to send an invoice to your customer for work you have completed. When the job is finished you can mark the ticket complete and send a final invoice. <br /></p>
