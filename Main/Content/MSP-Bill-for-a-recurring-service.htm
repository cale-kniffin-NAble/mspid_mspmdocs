        <h1 class="chapter">Bill for a recurring service</h1>
        <p class="Term">Question</p>
        <p>I provide my customers with recurring services that I bill them for each month. Do I have to open and complete a ticket each month?</p>
        <p class="Term">Answer</p>
        <p>You can set up Flat Fee Service Items, which do not need tickets attached in order to create bills. Flat fee contracts are great for managed services, and with only a few clicks you can create an invoice and export it to QuickBooks or Xero.</p>
