        <h1 class="chapter">How are users scored during ticket routing?</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> asks the following questions of each inbound ticket in order to calculate a user score. The score determines which user is assigned the ticket.</p>
        <p>The score is additive. The customer, location, and skill level questions add assigned users. Only workload reduces the assignment down to the user who is least busy.</p>
        <h3>Ticket routing questions</h3>
        <p>Is this user assigned to the customer?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes = 1</li>
            <li>No = 0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is this user assigned to the location?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes = 1</li>
            <li>No = 0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the user's skill level for this ticket issue type?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skill level 5 = 1</li>
            <li>Skill level 4 = 0.8</li>
            <li>Skill level 3 = 0.6</li>
            <li>Skill level 2 = 0.4</li>
            <li>Skill level 1 = 0.2</li>
            <li>Skill level 0 = 0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How was this user selected?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individually = 1</li>
            <li>As part of a team = 0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the user's workload?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low: few or no assigned tickets = 1</li>
            <li>Moderate: some assigned tickets = 0.2 - 0.8</li>
            <li>High: many assigned tickets = 0</li>
        </ul>
