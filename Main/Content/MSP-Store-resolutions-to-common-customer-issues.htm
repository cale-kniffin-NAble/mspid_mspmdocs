        <p class="Term">Question</p>
        <p>Is there a way to keep a log of fixes and resolutions?</p>
        <p class="Term">Answer</p>
        <p>Use the Knowledge &gt;&#160;Procedures section to store solutions to reoccurring issues and previously encountered problems. Create your company as a customer in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to track internal passwords, procedures, and serial numbers. </p>
        <p class="info">Include rich text and attachments in your procedures. </p>
