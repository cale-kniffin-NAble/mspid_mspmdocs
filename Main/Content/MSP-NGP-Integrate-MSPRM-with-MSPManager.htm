        <h1>Integrate your MSP RMM account with <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p>Integrate your MSP Remote Monitoring and Management account with <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> and the two products can work together to automatically create tickets,  import your customers and users, and update your assets. </p>
        <p>Import customers and users from your MSP&#160;RMM account, and apply <a href="MSP-NGP-Create-program-levels-for-multiple-customers.htm">Program Levels</a> and <a href="MSP-NGP-Charge-for-your-work-with-Service-items.htm">Service Items</a> to those customers in <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" />. </p>
        <p>After the integration is complete, your <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> account is populated with usable data like tickets, and customers that have Program Levels and Service Items assigned to them. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From your MSP&#160;RMM account, select Settings &gt; PSA Integration &gt; Setup. Select <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" style="font-weight: normal;" />, and click Next.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click Finish to continue to <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> where you can use the Setup Wizard to import all your MSP&#160;RMM customers, and assign program levels and service items to them.</li>
            <li>Configure your ticketing settings to auto create tickets for servers and work stations. This allows outages for those devices in MSP&#160;RMM&#160;to automatically create tickets in <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" />. Click Next.</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> creates a Program level based on your selections in the previous step. Modify the recommended Program Level by adding service items to it.<ol MadCap:continue="true"><li>Click Add new Program to create an additional Program Level.</li><li>Click Edit Program to modify the existing Program Level.</li><li>Click Add New Service Item to  add custom service items to the existing Program Level. </li><li>Click Next when finished. </li></ol></li>
            <li>The Customers section of the wizard imports your MSP&#160;RMM customers. Select a Program Level to add to each customer, and click Next.</li>
            <p class="hint">If you only created 1 program level, it is automatically assigned to each customer. Select the correct Program Level for each customer if you created additional programs. </p>
            <li>Select a role to apply to your imported MSP&#160;RMM users, and click Next. </li>
            <p class="info">Any user without a role is imported with an inactive status, and can be activated later. <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> assigns Administrator and Standard roles to these users by default. <a href="MSP-NGP-Roles-and-permissions.htm">Add additional roles and permissions</a>  from your account settings. </p>
            <li>The final page shows a summary of everything added to your account. Click Edit to make changes to each section if needed. </li>
            <li>Click Complete to finish the set up wizard.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> All customers and users from your RMM&#160;account are added to <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" />, and the Service Items in your selected Program Levels are assigned to your customers.</p>
