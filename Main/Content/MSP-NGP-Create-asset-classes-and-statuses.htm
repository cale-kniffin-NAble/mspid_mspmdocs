        <h1>Create asset classes and statuses</h1>
        <p>Asset classes and statuses are required to group assets by type. For example, servers, workstations, switches, and routers are common asset classes. Create as many classes as you need for your assets, as well as at least two asset statuses. </p>
        <p>Use <a href="MSP-Asset-tags.htm">Asset tags</a> for easy searching and filtering of your assets. </p>
        <h3>Create asset classes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to Settings &gt; Knowledge Settings &gt; Asset Classes &gt; Add  Asset Class.</li>
            <li>Enter a name and description of the device. For example, exchange servers, switches, routers, and workstations are common device names. </li>
            <li>Click Save.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Create asset statuses</h3>
        <p class="hint">A default status is required. As a best practice, create at least two statuses. For example, Active, and Decommissioned are the most common statuses. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to Settings &gt; Knowledge Settings &gt; Asset Status &gt; Add a New Asset Status.</li>
            <li>Enter a name and description.</li>
            <li>Choose a status and select Default Asset Status.</li>
            <li>Click Save.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The asset classes and statuses are saved to your account. They can be applied to new and imported devices as a way to organize your assets.</p>
