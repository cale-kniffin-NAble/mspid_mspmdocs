        <h1>Track user stats and billable hours from the Company Dashboard</h1>
        <p>The User Stats section of the Company Dashboard shows what your employees are working on and displays their hours for the day, week, month or year. This gives owners and managers a good understanding of how each employee is utilizing their time, and also displays a dollar amount each employee is bringing into the company. </p>
        <p>Navigate to Dashboards &gt; Company Dashboard &gt; User Stats to view this part of the Company Dashboard. </p>
        <p>When viewing the User Stats page, the columns for  Tickets Worked and Hours Worked  are broken down into three categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Billable - displayed in green and represents tickets that are completed, but have not yet been billed.</li>

            <li>Unbillable - represents tickets that have been marked as not billable. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="info">In progress tickets that have not been completed and are not yet ready for billing are displayed in orange for each user. <br /></p>
