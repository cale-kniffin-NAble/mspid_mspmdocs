        <h1>Uninstall Service Desk and install <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> as an integrated account</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to your SolarWinds&#160;Remote Management dashboard and select Settings &gt; PSA Integration &gt; Uninstall.</li>
            <li>Choose from the following options:<ol><li>Check the box next to Delete Service Desk to ensure your account is deleted. Failure to do so will result in the conversion of your account to a standalone product, and you will continue to be billed accordingly. </li><li>Do not check the Delete Service Desk box if you want to migrate your Service Desk data over to MSP Manager. This option keeps Service Desk as a standalone instance and the account can be deleted after the migration is complete. </li></ol><p class="warning">Standalone Service Desk instances are considered billable accounts.</p></li>
