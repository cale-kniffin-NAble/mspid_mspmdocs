        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to your SolarWinds&#160;Remote Management dashboard and select Settings &gt; PSA Integration &gt; Uninstall.</li>
            <li value="2">Choose from the following options:<ol><li value="1">Check the box next to Delete Service Desk to ensure your account is deleted. Failure to do so will result in the conversion of your account to a standalone product, and you will continue to be billed accordingly. </li><li value="2">Do not check the Delete Service Desk box if you want to migrate your Service Desk data over to MSP Manager. This option keeps Service Desk as a standalone instance and the account can be deleted after the migration is complete. </li></ol><p class="warning">Standalone Service Desk instances are considered billable accounts.</p></li>
            <li value="3">Click on Settings &gt; PSA Integration &gt; Setup.</li>
            <li value="4">Select MSP Manager from the list and click Next.</li>
            <li value="5">Click Finish to open the MSP&#160;Manager Integration Out of Box wizard and setup your new account.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="info">If you already have an MSP Manager instance, you must authenticate with the existing MSP Manager Owner account credentials in order to join the two systems.</p>
        <p class="nugget">To cancel your Service Desk subscription, <a href="https://support.solarwindsmsp.com/portal/new-case/">submit a support case</a> and request that your Service Desk account be deleted. </p>
