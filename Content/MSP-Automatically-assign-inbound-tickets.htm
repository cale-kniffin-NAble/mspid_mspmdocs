        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> allows ticket creation from external sources, including by email, the customer portal, and from N-central.</p>
        <p>To view inbound requests, click <span class="Term">Helpdesk</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="Term">Ticket Requests</span>. Click <span class="Term">Create Ticket</span> to convert an inbound request to a new ticket.</p>
        <p>The <a href="MSP-Prerequisites-for-ticket-routing.htm">ticket routing feature</a> allows an externally created ticket request from the customer portal or via email to be automatically converted to a new ticket, and assigned to a customer and technician.</p>
        <h2>How does ticket routing work?</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> uses <a href="MSP-Define-rules-for-ticket-routing.htm">ticket routing rules</a>  to determine which users to assign to a ticket, as well as an algorithm to evaluate each user against the ticket routing rules. </p>
        <p>Each ticket routing rule produces a value in the range of 0 - 5 for each user. The user with the highest score is assigned the ticket. In the case of a numerical tie, <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> assigns the ticket to all of the users with the highest score.</p>
