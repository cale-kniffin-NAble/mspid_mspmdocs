        <h1>Accounting software integration</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> integrates with QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, and Xero. Learn how to correctly set up the integration with your accounting software and export your invoices from <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" />. If you are not using one of these accounting software options, you can export your invoices as a general CSV file. </p>
        <p class="nugget">If you are not using an accounting program that integrates with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />, it is recommended to move your tickets through the billing process as to not affect ticketing functionality. <a href="MSP-NGP-Run-a-billing-batch.htm">Create a billing batch</a> and generate invoices, then leave the billing batch in the billing section of your account. This will move the tickets from a Completed State to a Billed state, and they will no longer load by default when accessing the Helpdesk or Tickets sections of your account. </p>
