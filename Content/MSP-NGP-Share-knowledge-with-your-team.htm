        <h1>Share knowledge with your team</h1>
        <p>Navigate to the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Knowledge</span> &gt; <b>Legacy Knowledge</b> section of your <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> account to view  centralized information about your customers.</p>
        <p class="nugget">Each knowledge item previously listed in the <b>Legacy Knowledge</b> section has been migrated to a new knowledge template labeled according to the knowledge type (Password-migrated, Procedure-migrated, Expiry-migrated), populating one password per article in that new template. </p>
        <h3>Passwords</h3>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> stores the login, password, and notes fields using 256-bit encryption and securely transmits using a 128-bit SSL connection. </p>
        <p>For an additional layer of security, you can set a password secret for individual passwords, giving you two-factor authentication.</p>
        <p>Navigate to the <b>Knowledge</b> &gt; <b>Password-migrated</b> section in the left navigation pane to view all migrated passwords. </p>
        <p class="warning">If you forget your password secret, your encrypted data is only recoverable by the <a href="MSP-Reveal-any-password-with-the-owner-secret.htm">owner secret</a>.</p>
        <h3>Procedures</h3>
        <p>Document steps for common tasks and edge case scenarios. Examples include:
        <ul><li>Software or hardware installations</li><li>Migrating user settings to a new computer</li><li>How to set up a new printer</li></ul><p class="info">Use drag and drop functionality to imbed images  into rich text fields. Do not copy and paste as this will display a broken image. </p></p>
        <h3>Serial Numbers</h3>
        <p>Store unique identifiers for hardware and software. Examples include:
        <ul><li>A&#160;volume license key for Microsoft Windows</li><li>The Service Tag for a Dell server</li><li>The serial number on a Cisco router</li></ul></p>
        <h3>Expiry</h3>
        <p>Add expiration dates for software licenses and support contracts. Set email notification options for expiry items in <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Notifications</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="ButtonMenuNote">Notification Settings</span>.</p>
        <h3>Assets</h3>
        <p>Listed separately from the Knowledge menu, but very much apart of the centralized knowledge items in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> is the <b>Assets</b> section. Here you can store information about your customers' computers, servers and devices. <a href="MSP-NGP-Integrate-Ncentral-and-MSPM.htm">Integrate  <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.N-central" /></a>to import devices, and map them to service items in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to create tickets automatically when alerts are triggered in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.N-central" />.</p>
