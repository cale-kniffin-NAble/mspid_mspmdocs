        <h1>Share knowledge with your team</h1>
        <p>Navigate to <span class="Term">Knowledge</span> &gt; <b>Legacy Knowledge</b> to centralize and share all important information about your customers with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />.</p>
        <h2>Passwords</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> stores the login, password, and notes fields using 256-bit encryption and securely transmits using a 128-bit SSL connection.</p>
        <p>For an additional layer of security, you can set a password secret for individual passwords, giving you two-factor authentication.</p>
        <p class="warning">If you forget your password secret, your encrypted data is only recoverable by the <a href="MSP-Reveal-any-password-with-the-owner-secret.htm">owner secret</a>.</p>
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>Document steps for common tasks and edge case scenarios. Examples include:
        <ul><li>Software or hardware installations</li><li>Migrating user settings to a new computer</li><li>How to set up a new printer</li></ul><p class="info">Use drag and drop functionality to imbed images  into rich text fields. Do not copy and paste as this will display a broken image. </p></p>
        <h2>Serial Numbers</h2>
        <p>Store unique identifiers for hardware and software. Examples include:
        <ul><li>A&#160;volume license key for Microsoft Windows</li><li>The Service Tag for a Dell server</li><li>The serial number on a Cisco router</li></ul></p>
        <h2>Expiry</h2>
        <p>Add expiration dates for software licenses and support contracts. Set email notification options for expiry items in <span class="Term">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Notifications</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="Term">Notification Settings</span>.</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>Listed separately from the Knowledge menu, but very much apart of the centralized knowledge items in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> is the <b>Assets</b> section. Here you can store information about your customers' computers, servers and devices. <a href="MSP-NGP-Integrate-Ncentral-and-MSPM.htm">Integrate  <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.N-central" /></a>to import devices, and map them to service items in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to create tickets automatically when alerts are triggered in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.N-central" />.</p>
