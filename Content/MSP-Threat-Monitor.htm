        <h1>Introduction to Threat Monitor for MSSPs</h1>
        <p>Threat Monitor is a SIEM – a security incident and event management tool. It collects data from network devices and passes that data to the MSSP (managed service and security provider), providing a number of ways to parse and analyze the data. Threat Monitor is split into two major components: a Collector and the Web UI. The Collector is the part of Threat Monitor that gathers data from network devices in the form of logs. The Collector then indexes the data and sends it to the appropriate storage location for the Web UI to access. The Web UI is used to search and analyze the data gathered by the Collector and to configure some of the settings for Collectors.</p>
        <p>To begin using Threat Monitor, the MSSP contacts SolarWinds MSP and works with an onboarding specialist. The onboarding process follows a series of questions with the MSSP to get information about their network so the onboarding specialist can build the Collectors to fit the specific network configuration needs of the MSSP. After the Collectors are built, they are sent to the customer as OVF files.</p>
