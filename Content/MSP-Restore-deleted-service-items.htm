        <h1>Recover deleted service items</h1>
        <p>Anytime a service item is deleted, whether accidentally or intentionally, it not only removes the service item from your <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Short" /> account, but it also deletes the associated tickets to which the service item was applied. With the ability to recover deleted service items, you can not only restore and re-apply that service item to its assigned customers, but you can also restore any associated tickets that were deleted along with the service item. </p>
