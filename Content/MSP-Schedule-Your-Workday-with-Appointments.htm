        <p>Use the scheduling feature to add an appointment to your calendar as a reminder to look into an issue. Appointments typically represent an on-site visit, remote desktop troubleshooting session, or a follow-up phone call.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click&#160;<span class="Term">Scheduling</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Term">Add an Appointment</span>, or place your cursor on the calendar at the desired start time and double-click.</li>
            <li>Enter the appointment information, and search and select tickets to associate with the appointment.</li>
            <li>Click&#160;<span class="Term">Add an Appointment</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> automatically sends an iCalendar meeting invitation to the consultant's email. Compatible software includes Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and any other calendar application that supports the iCalendar file format.</p>
        <p class="info">Changes made to the appointment in the calendar application are not synced back to <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />. All updates to appointments should be made in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />.</p>
        <h2>Update an appointment time</h2>
        <p>Drag the appointment to the new start and end time. Whenever updates are made to an appointment, an iCalendar meeting update is automatically  sent to the consultant's email.</p>
        <h2>Associate a new ticket with an existing appointment</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Double-click an appointment.</li>
            <li>Locate the new ticket.</li>
            <li>Select the new ticket, and click <span class="Term">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
