        <h1>Bill for partially completed tickets</h1>
        <p>When you need to bill a customer for a job that is taking longer than expected, you do not have to  complete the ticket prior to billing. Send invoices for completed time and accumulated expense items without closing the ticket. </p>
        <p> Track your time using an hourly service item, and send your customer an invoice  for all completed time entries, and attached expense items, without closing or completing the ticket. Apply the partial billing feature to your service items to get started. </p>
        <h2>Apply partial billing to a service item</h2>
