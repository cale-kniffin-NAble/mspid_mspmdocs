        <h1>Bill for partially completed tickets</h1>
        <p>When you need to bill a customer for a job that is taking longer than expected, you do not have to  complete the ticket prior to billing. Send invoices for completed time and accumulated expense items without closing the ticket. </p>
        <p> Track your time using an hourly service item, and send your customer an invoice  for all completed time entries, and attached expense items, without closing or completing the ticket. Apply the partial billing feature to your service items to get started. </p>
        <h3>Apply partial billing to a service item</h3>

            <li>Navigate to <img src="Resources/Images/MSPManagerIcons/SelectCustomer.png" style="width: 19px;height: 19px;" class="no_border" /> and select a customer from the list. </li>

            <li>Enter a ticket title and confirm the hourly service item with partial billing is selected. </li>

        <p>The completed time entries and expense items in the tickets associated with the selected service item are included on the invoice. The ticket remains open, and the completed time entries are marked as billed within the ticket. </p>
        <p>Continue tracking your time in the same ticket, and repeat this process anytime you want to send invoices to customers for work you have completed. When the job is finished you can mark the ticket complete and send a final invoice to the customer.<br /></p>
