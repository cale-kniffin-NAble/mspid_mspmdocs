        <p><b>FAQ</b>
        </p>

        <p>This is your opportunity to anticipate your customer’s questions. Look at your integration with a fresh set of eyes and think about what customers might want to know. Don’t be afraid to link to additional articles that dive deep into the topic.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do I disconnect from Xero?</li>
            <li>What doesn’t your integration do?</li>
            <li>How do payment processing fees appear in Xero?</li>
            <li>How do I reconcile sales data synced to Xero?</li>
            <li>When and how does data sync occur? Is it manual, automatic, on login, in real-time. Are there any settings related to synchronizing?</li>
            <li>As your support team fields questions, look for recurring patterns and expand your FAQs over time. Your support docs should grow along with your customer base.</li>
