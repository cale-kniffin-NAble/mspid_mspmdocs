        <h1>Track your work with helpdesk tickets</h1>
        <p>Manage your helpdesk with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />'s intuitive ticketing and time tracking system. <a href="MSP-NGP-Log-time-spent-on-tickets.htm">Use timers to accurately track your time</a> in a ticket, <a href="MSP-NGP-Bill-for-partially-complete-tickets.htm">bill your customers for partially completed work</a> or mark the ticket complete and generate invoices at the end of the month. Export your invoices to one of <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />'s <a href="MSP-NGP-Accounting-software-integration.htm">integrated accounting systems</a> and send those invoices to your customers. </p>
        <p class="nugget">If you are not using an accounting program that integrates with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />, it is recommended to move your tickets through the billing process as to not affect ticketing functionality. <a href="MSP-NGP-Run-a-billing-batch.htm">Create a billing batch</a> and generate invoices, then leave the billing batch in the billing section of your account. This will move the tickets from a Completed State to a Billed state, and they will no longer load by default when accessing the Tickets or Helpdesk  sections of your account. </p>
        <h3>Add a new helpdesk ticket</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Helpdesk</span> and click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Add Ticket</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter the Customer Information, Ticket Properties and Details.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Add Time Entry</b> to add time to the ticket or <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Save and Start a Timer</span> to start tracking your time. </li>
            <li>Click <b>Save Ticket</b> to capture all the information</li>
            <li>To add additional information to a ticket, click <img src="Resources/Images/MSPManagerIcons/down.png" style="vertical-align: middle;width: 13px;height: 8px;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 0px;border-left-color: #222222;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 0px;border-right-color: #222222;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 0px;border-top-color: #222222;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-bottom-color: #222222;" /> to the right of the ticket in the Helpdesk to access a list of ticket options.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="warning">The ticket subject has a limit of 256 characters, and truncates anything over that limit. </p>
        <h3>Display of Ticket Details</h3>
        <p>The details of a ticket can be displayed multiple ways: in either the Ticket Details section of the ticket, as a read-only response in the Responses section of a ticket, or you can configure it to display in both areas. Navigate to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Tickets &amp; Workflows</b> &gt; <b>Ticket Preferences</b> to configure how ticket details are displayed.</p>
        <h3>Search for tickets</h3>
        <p>Click <img src="Resources/Images/MSPManagerIcons/TicketSearch.png" style="width: 20px;height: 20px;" class="no_border" /> at the top of the ticket list to open the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Ticket Search </span>field.  From the Helpdesk or a customer's ticketing section, you can select the drop down arrow to the left of the search field to switch between Local and Global search. The  Ticket Search option searches for tickets locally by default. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Local search looks for only the tickets in a specific list. For instance, a Local search from a customer's ticketing section searches through all the tickets in the list assigned to that customer.</li>
            <li> A Global search from the Helpdesk will search all tickets for all customers. A Global search from a customer's ticketing section searches for all tickets for the currently selected customer. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nugget">When searching locally, you can first apply filters to the ticket list, then use the search option to search within the filtered list. </p>
        <p class="info">If you are searching for tickets by ticket number, you can place a # in front of the ticket number to search only the ticket number field. This looks for a single match and opens the ticket editor for that ticket. Not using a # returns matches from all search fields within the selected tickets. </p>
