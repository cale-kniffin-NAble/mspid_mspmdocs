        <h1>Create Program Levels, Service Plans and Service Items</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Documents.ProductShortName" /> uses Program Levels, Service Plans and Service Items to customize how you track work and bill your customers. Use Program Levels to create different types of contracts for your customers depending on what type of services you provide. This is a useful way to group together multiple Service Items, allowing you to charge for different types of work in different ways, such as hourly contracts or one-time projects.</p>
