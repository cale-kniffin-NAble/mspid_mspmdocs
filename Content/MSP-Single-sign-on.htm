        <h1>Single Sign-on</h1>
        <p>The Single Sign-On service allows users to access our supported product portfolio through a single login. After the user's credentials are registered with the Single Sign-On service, a single login is used to access all supported SolarWinds products.</p>
        <p>Single Sign-On has the following benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides the user with full control over their login.</li>
            <li>Makes logging into multiple products much easier - the user only has to remember one username and password.</li>
            <li>Improves security - login credentials are only entered once in the Single Sign-On service, which leads to reduced exposure of usernames and passwords.</li>
            <li>Makes it easier to apply the companyâ€™s login policy as there is only one login to manage.</li>
            <li>Simplifies switching between products through the Navigator bar.</li>
            <li>Increases productivity as users spend less time attempting to login as well as potentially reduce the administrative burden of dealing with lost credential requests.</li>
            <li>Encourages the use of more complex passwords as there is only one login to remember.</li>
        </ul>
