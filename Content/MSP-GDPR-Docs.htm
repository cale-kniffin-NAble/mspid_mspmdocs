        <h1>What is the General Data Protection Regulation?</h1>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes the rights of citizens of the European Union (EU) regarding how their personal data is used, processed, and shared. The regulation outlines several important rights for individuals, including the right to access their personal information, ask for corrections, and request that an organization delete  or cease sharing that information.</p>
        <p>Meant to update existing EU privacy laws, GDPR extends regulatory requirements from any organization located in the EU, to those who store or process the personal data of EU citizens. This not only applies to organizations located within the EU, but also to organizations located outside of the EU if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of EU data subjects. </p>
        <p>The GDPR affects all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company’s location.</p>
        <p>Beginning on May 25, 2018, organizations around the globe—from sole proprietors to small businesses to multinational corporations—must comply with the GDPR rules or face the threat of potentially heavy fines (up to 4% of the company’s worldwide turnover or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater).</p>
        <h2>Data controllers and processors must protect the personal data of data subjects</h2>
        <p><b>Data controller</b> - an individual or group that decides how data is stored, collected or processed.</p>
        <p><b>Data processor</b> - an individual or group that processes data on behalf of a data collector (collecting, altering, transferring, using, storing data, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Personal data</b> - any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as names, photos, addresses, bank details, and phone numbers.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data subjects</span> - individuals located in the EU who have their data stored or processed by a data controller or data processor.</p>
        <h2>Everyone has a joint liability to protect personal data for data subjects and should employ:</h2>
        <p><b>Data minimization techniques</b> - review what data you are collecting and try to collect the smallest amount of data needed.</p>
        <p><b>Pseudonymization</b> -  process personal data so it cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information.</p>
        <p><b>Notifications</b> - data controllers must alert the supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovering a data breach.</p>
        <p><b>Explicit consent</b> - if consent is required to collect and process data, that consent from the user must be clear and unambiguous.</p>
        <p><b>Fair and transparent data processing</b> - the data controller must provide information to data subjects about the processing of their personal data, unless they already have it.</p>
        <h2>Data Subjects are granted 8 rights under GDPR:</h2>
        <p><b>Right to be informed</b> - Data subjects have the right to know what data is being collected and stored, and what is being done with it.</p>
        <p><b>Right of access</b> - Data subjects have the right to see what specific data is being stored, used and processed, and can request access to it at any time. </p>
        <p><b>Right to rectification</b> - Data subjects can request that their personal data be modified and updated if it is inaccurate.</p>
        <p><b>Right to erasure</b> - Data subjects can request their data be deleted if it no longer serves a legitimate purpose. This is also known as the right to be forgotten.  </p>
        <p><b>Right to restrict processing</b> - Data subjects can prevent their data from being processed for various reasons. However, customer data can only be stored for the purpose of legal or financial reasons, or for a specific purpose. For example, keeping data on who has trialed certain products, but stored data can not be used to market to customers. </p>
        <p><b>Right to data portability</b> - Data subjects must be able to receive and re-use their information, and the data controller must provide data in a structured and useful format. Data subjects have the right to have their data moved to a different supplier, and <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.CompanyName" /> must assist with this transfer if possible. If we can not process the transfer directly then we must provide the data to the customer in an easily readable format, like a CSV file. </p>
        <p><b>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</b> - Data subjects have the right to object to data processing or collection done in an automated fashion (without human intervention). There must always be a human involved in data processing decisions. </p>
        <p><b>Right to object</b> - Data subjects have the right to opt out of having their data used in certain circumstances, such as direct marketing or profiling.</p>
