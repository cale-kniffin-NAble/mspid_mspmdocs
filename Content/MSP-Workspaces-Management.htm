        <h1>Create and manage Workspaces</h1>
        <p>Workspaces are a collection of different Workspace Pages consisting of  customized Widgets that provide key information on a per user basis. Each user can create a personal Workspace with multiple Pages to track the information they need to monitor specific customers. A single Workspace Page can contain multiple Widgets to track things like the assigned customer's asset details, a list of tickets, contacts, locations, or service items. </p>
        <p>Stay organized by creating and customizing workspaces for each of your assigned customers and view only the tickets, assets and service items for that one customer. With the Workspace grid, you can shape and re-size the Widgets on each page however you would like, and add as many Widgets to each workspace that you need. </p>
        <p>Managers can create charts to track ticket progress, view specific user statistics or a real-time work time line for selected users to keep a close eye on progress. </p>
