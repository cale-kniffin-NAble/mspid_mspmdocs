        <h1>Scheduling video script</h1>
        <p>Use the scheduling section of <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to add an appointment to your calendar as a reminder to look into an issue. Appointments typically represent an on-site visit, remote desktop troubleshooting session, or a follow-up phone call.</p>
        <p>You can also create schedules that contain recurring tickets and appointments for your customers. Recurring tickets are a great way to track time  for monthly proactive maintenance, or regular tasks that technicians need to complete on a daily or weekly basis. Tickets are automatically created based on the recurrence frequency selected during creation, and notifications are sent to alert technicians when a new ticket has been assigned to them. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To create an appointment, navigate to the Scheduling section of your <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> account and click Appointments. </li>
            <li>In the top right corner, select Add Appointment. Fill out the Appointment Information by assigning a user and customer to the appointment, and entering a subject. You can also optionally add a location or enter additional details about the appointment. </li>
