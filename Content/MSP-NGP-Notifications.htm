        <h1>Notifications</h1>
        <p>Notifications can alert your customers about changes to open tickets, or updates to their account. Internal notifications also help to inform technicians about updates to tickets, or changes to knowledge or expiry items for customers to which they are assigned. Keep customers and technicians informed any time a new ticket is opened, or an existing ticket is updated. </p>
