        <h1>Configure mailbox reply settings for specific customers</h1>
        <p>Delete this text and replace it with your own content.</p>
        <p>Image file notes – no larger than 200KB</p>
        <p>Add new mailbox – select ‘send reply using MSPM service’</p>
        <p>Mail goes thru Mail Assure now but we put the partners mailbox and it comes off as an attempt at spoofing</p>
        <p>Partners need to indicate MSPM mail is safe</p>
        <p>Now we can send mail using partners mailbox, not mail assure, this is a way for partners to control security settings, so mail MSPM sends will not be flagged as spoofing mail</p>
        <p>Confusing for partners to ‘Use those settings for the following customers’ – only used in case of more than 1 monitored mailbox and they want to send mail to specific customers from a specific mailbox</p>
        <p>If nothing is selected then no override and if all mailboxes are set to ‘reply using this mailbox’ then full security is in place for all mailboxes</p>
        <p>If DMARC is an issue then always send through their own mailbox</p>
        <p>If there is more than 1 mailbox then other settings comes into play – make one the default and any custs not listed</p>
        <p>For additional mailboxes listed, that’s where customers can specify using the mailbox reply settings field</p>
        <p>Add new topic for sending through own mailbox, key benefit is full control over email security</p>
        <p>Assign a ticket mailbox to specific partners is different now – need to update topic</p>
