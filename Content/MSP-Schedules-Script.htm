        <h1>Scheduling video script</h1>
        <p>Use the scheduling section of <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to add an appointment to your calendar as a reminder to look into an issue or call a customer about a support issue. Appointments typically represent things like on-site visits, remote desktop troubleshooting sessions, or a follow-up phone calls. Schedules are containers for appointments, but appointments can stand alone on their own.</p>
        <p>You can also create schedules that contain recurring tickets and appointments for your customers. Recurring tickets are a great way to track time  for monthly proactive maintenance, or regular tasks that technicians need to complete on a daily or weekly basis. Tickets are automatically created based on the recurrence frequency selected during creation, and notifications are sent to alert technicians when a new ticket has been assigned to them. </p>
        <h3>Let's start with creating an appointment</h3>

        <h3>Now let's create a schedule</h3>
        <p>Schedules are used to create recurring tickets and appointments for your customers. You can use recurring tickets to track time for monthly proactive maintenance, or regular tasks your technicians need to complete. Tickets are automatically created based on the recurrence frequency, and notifications alert employees when a new ticket has been assigned to them.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the Scheduling section of your <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> account and click <b>Schedules</b>. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPMScreenshots/Schedules.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;width: 179px;height: 326px;" /></li>

Depending on the Recurrence option that is selected, additional options are available, like the day of the week and time of day, for instance. Enter the additional information and specify a time zone. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPMScreenshots/ScheduleProperties.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;width: 409px;height: 242px;" /></li>
            <li>Select a Start and End date for when the schedule begins and ends.</li>
            <li>In the Additional Items section of the Schedule editor, you have the option to add a recurring ticket or appointment to the schedule. <ul><li>Click Add Recurring Ticket and fill out the Ticket Schedule Title, Details, Issue Type and Customer information fields. Save the Recurring Ticket to add it to the schedule.</li><li>Click Add Recurring Appointment and fill out the Appointment Information and Appointment Scheduling sections.

            <li>Save the schedule to make it active. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>As the newly added schedule continues to execute over the course of the next weeks and months, you can use the Audit Logs section of the scheduling editor to view the type of action and details of the schedule.
