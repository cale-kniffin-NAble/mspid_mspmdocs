        <h1>Scheduling video script</h1>
        <p>Use the scheduling section of <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to add an appointment to your calendar as a reminder to look into an issue or call a customer about a support issue. Appointments typically represent things like on-site visits, remote desktop troubleshooting sessions, or a follow-up phone calls.</p>
        <p>You can also create schedules that contain recurring tickets and appointments for your customers. Recurring tickets are a great way to track time  for monthly proactive maintenance, or regular tasks that technicians need to complete on a daily or weekly basis. Tickets are automatically created based on the recurrence frequency selected during creation, and notifications are sent to alert technicians when a new ticket has been assigned to them. </p>
        <h3>Let's start with creating an appointment</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the Scheduling section of your <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> account and click Appointments. </li>
            <li>In the top right corner, select Add Appointment. Fill out the Appointment Information by assigning a user and customer to the appointment, and entering a subject. You can also optionally add a location or enter additional details about the appointment. <br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPMScreenshots/EditAppt.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;width: 227px;height: 371px;" MadCap:conditions="Default.comment" /></li>
            <li>In the Appointment Scheduling section of the appointment editor, select a start and end date for the appointment. </li>
            <li>In the Appointment Association section, you have the option to link a ticket to the appointment. Use the search field find the ticket number or title, select the tickets you want to associate to the appointment and click Save. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can now view the new appointment in your appointments calendar, and drag and drop any appointments to a new time if needed. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> automatically sends an iCalendar meeting invitation to the technician's email. This iCal invite is compatible with Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and any other calendar application that supports the iCalendar file format.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/MSPMScreenshots/SchedulingScript.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;width: 606px;height: 339px;" /></p>
        <h3>Now let's create a schedule</h3>
        <p>Schedules are used to create recurring tickets and appointments for your customers. You can use recurring tickets to track time for monthly proactive maintenance, or regular tasks your technicians need to complete. Tickets are automatically created based on the recurrence frequency, and notifications alert employees when a new ticket has been assigned to them.</p>
