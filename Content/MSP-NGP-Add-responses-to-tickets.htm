        <h1>Email customers from inside a ticket</h1>
        <p>You can email customers from inside a ticket to follow up on, or get more information about their issue. Add a response to send an email to any customer contact in your <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> account. Your message and the customers reply are saved to the Responses section of the ticket. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Helpdesk</span> &gt; <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Add  Ticket</span>.</li>
            <li>Select a customer and a service item. </li>
            <li>Enter a ticket title.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Add Response</span>.</li>
            <li>Select a contact from the list. </li>
            <li>Enter your response and click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Save</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The response is sent to your customer, and all recipients are saved to the ticket as contacts. View your conversation history in the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Responses</span> tab of the ticket. </p>
        <h3>View tickets with unread responses</h3>
        <p>When a customer sends a response to a ticket and that response has not been viewed, the ticket is marked with this icon <img src="Resources/Images/MSPManagerIcons/UnreadResponse.png" style="width: 23px;height: 20px;" class="no_border" /> in the ticket list. </p>
        <p>Click the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Sort by</span> option at the top of your ticket list and select <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Unread Response</span> to view all tickets containing responses from customers that have not been viewed. </p>
        <p>Open the ticket and click <img src="Resources/Images/MSPManagerIcons/MarkResponseAsRead.png" style="width: 10px;height: 20px;" class="no_border" /> to mark the response as read:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/MSPMScreenshots/MarkUnreadResponse.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <h3>Send carbon copy responses</h3>
        <p>You can save any email address in the Carbon Copy (Cc) response field. All CC'd customer emails sent to your <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> ticket mailbox are saved to the Cc Email field in the details of the ticket. Additionally, you can add a contact to the Cc Email field  and that contact is automatically added to the Cc field for all future responses from that ticket. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From inside a ticket, click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Add Response</span>. </li>
            <li>Select a contact from the list.</li>
            <p class="info">If a contact has been added to the ticket, the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">To </span>field is populated with that contacts email. </p>
            <li>Click the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Cc</span> link  to add the carbon copy field to the response. </li>
            <li>Enter any email address and click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Add Option</span>, or select a contact email from the list.</li>
            <li>Enter your response and click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The response is sent to your customers, and all carbon copied recipients are saved to the ticket. Future responses  will auto populate the To and Cc fields with the saved contact's email addresses. </p>
