        <h1>Create custom ticket statuses </h1>
        <p>Customize your <MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> account by creating unique statuses for your ticket work flow. Keep your tickets organized with custom statuses that reflect your exact business practices. Custom ticket statuses can be grouped into the standard statuses (New, Assigned, In Progress, On Hold, Complete, Reviewed, Billed) and selected from within the ticket editor. </p>
        <p>Create multiple Reviewed statuses for different departments to double check tickets before billing your customers, or multiple Assigned statuses depending what department or technician is best suited to handle the issue. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Ticket Routing</span> &gt; <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Ticket Statuses</span>.</li>
            <li>In the Status Editor, you will see a list of all hard coded ticket statuses (New, Assigned, In Progress, etc). Click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Add new</span> next to the ticket status to which you want to add a custom status. </li>
            <li>Enter a name and description for the new status and click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Save</span>. </li>
            <li>Continue to add  custom statuses as needed for your business' ticketing practices. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The new custom statuses are now available to add to tickets from within the Status section of the ticket editor. </p>
        <p>Use Ticket Filters in the Helpdesk or in a customer's ticketing page to sort and view all tickets by their specific status. You can also <a href="MSP-NGP-Run-reports-to-track-business.htm">run reports for tickets with custom statuses</a>.</p>
        <p>Combine custom ticket statuses with <a href="MSP-NGP-Ticket-queues.htm">ticket queues</a> to stay organized and make sure all issues are assigned to and fixed by the appropriate department or technician.</p>
