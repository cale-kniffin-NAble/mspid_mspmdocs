        <h1>Add Canned Responses to tickets</h1>
        <p>Technicians can spend hours replying to customers from within their tickets, often times writing out the same response for different customers with the same issue. Save time by adding Canned Responses to your tickets so you can quickly and easily respond to common customer issues. </p>
        <p>Canned Responses are separated into Shared and Personal categories. Shared Canned Responses can be viewed and used in tickets by any technician with the appropriate permissions, and Personal Canned Responses are unique to each <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> user. </p>
        <p>Before getting started, make sure technicians who communicate with customers have the appropriate permissions configured.</p>
        <h3>Configure permissions for Canned Responses</h3>
        <p>Make sure all technicians who need to configure ticket mailboxes have the necessary permissions to do so.</p>
