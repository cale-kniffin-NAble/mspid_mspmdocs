        <h1>Set company notifications for system and user actions</h1>
        <p>Set company-wide and external email notifications for users and customers. Notifications can be set to trigger when an action is taken on tickets, knowledge information, or service items.  You can define who within your company is notified when an inbound ticket is received, and which customer is notified when tickets are created and updated. Create Notification Templates to choose between HTML or plain text notifications. </p>

        <h3>Expiry notifications for knowledge and service items </h3>
        <p>The Knowledge and Service Items Notifications sections allow for the configuration of reminder notifications for expiring service items or licenses, certificates, or subscriptions listed in the Expiry section of the Knowledge area. </p>

Notifications continue to be sent out each day for the expiring or expired items until the  knowledge or service item is updated. </p>
