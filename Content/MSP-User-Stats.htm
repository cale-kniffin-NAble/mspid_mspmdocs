        <h1>Track user stats, activity, service utilization and billable hours from the Company Dashboard</h1>
        <p>The company dashboard shows what your employees are working on and displays their hours for the day, week, month or year. This gives owners and managers a good understanding of how each employee is utilizing their time, and also displays a dollar amount each employee is bringing into the company. </p>
        <p>When viewing the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">User Stats</span> page, the columns for  <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Tickets Worked</span> and <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Hours Worked</span>  are broken down into three categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Billable - displayed in green and represents tickets that are completed, but have not yet been billed.</li>
            <li>Billed -  displayed in blue and represents tickets that have been billed. </li>
            <li>Unbillable - represents tickets that have been marked as not billable. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="info">In progress tickets that have not been completed and are not yet ready for billing are displayed in orange for each user. <br /></p>
