        <h1>Create and apply Program Levels  to multiple customers</h1>
        <p>A Program Level is a container for all of the different services that your business offers. Use Program Levels to apply multiple <a href="MSP-Service-Plans.htm">Service Plans</a> to one or all of your customers, and group together those services based on your business needs.  Add multiple Service Plans to each Program Level according to the type of  contracts and services that you provide. Apply Program Levels to your customers to add all the attached Service Plans.</p>
