        <p class="Term">Question</p>
        <p>Can I bill tickets individually when the work is completed, or does it have to be part of a billing batch?</p>
        <p class="Term">Answer</p>
        <p>You can bill a completed ticket at any time. Mark the ticket as complete and it will appear ready for billing under the appropriate customer in Billing. </p>
