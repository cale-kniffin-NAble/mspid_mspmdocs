        <h1>Create asset classes and statuses</h1>
        <p>Asset classes and statuses are required to group assets by type. For example, servers, workstations, switches, and routers are common asset classes. Create as many classes as you need for your assets, as well as at least two asset statuses. </p>
        <p>Use <a href="MSP-NGP-Asset-tags.htm">Asset tags</a> for easy searching and filtering of your assets. </p>
        <h2>Create asset classes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="Term">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Assets</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Asset Classes</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Add  Asset Class</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter a name and description of the device. For example, exchange servers, switches, routers, and workstations are common device names. </li>
            <li>Select <span class="Term">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also <a href="MSP-Custom-Asset-fields.htm">create custom fields for asset classes </a>that fit the exact needs of your customers' assets. </p>
        <h2>Create asset statuses</h2>
        <p class="hint">A default status is required. As a best practice, create at least two statuses. For example, Active, and Decommissioned are the most common statuses. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="Term">Settings</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Assets</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Asset Statuses</span> &gt; <span class="Term">Add a New Asset Status</span>.</li>
            <li>Enter a name and description.</li>
            <li>Choose a status and select <span class="Term">Default Asset Status</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="Term">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The asset classes and statuses are saved to your account. They can be applied to new and imported devices as a way to organize your assets.</p>
