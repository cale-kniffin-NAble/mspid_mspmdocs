        <h1>Create Ticket Tasks and Task Templates</h1>
        <p>Use Task Templates to apply a pre-configured list of tasks to a ticket. Categorize Task Templates based on common issues reported by your customers, and provide a check list of tasks that technicians can use to diagnose and fix the problem. </p>
        <p>Add additional tasks to a ticket after applying a template, or create one-off tasks that are not part of a template. When a task is marked complete, a time entry is added to the ticket to account for the time needed to complete the task. </p>
        <h2>Create Task Templates</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Tickets &amp; Workflows</strong> and select <strong>Task Templates</strong>. </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Add Task Template</strong> and enter a name and description for the template, and click <strong>Add A New Task</strong>.</li>
            <li>Enter a name, description and estimated time for the task, and select a parent task from the <strong>Dependency</strong> field, if applicable.</li>
            <p class="info">The <strong>Dependency</strong> field contains a parent task that requires a separate dependent task to be completed first. The dependent task has an orange dot next to it which indicates the pending dependency.</p>

            <li>Select a <b>Task Template</b> from the drop down menu, or click <strong>Add Task</strong> to create a new task for the ticket and enter a name for the new list of tasks.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Add Task</strong> and enter a name, description, estimated time, task owner and assigned user. Select a parent Task from the <strong>Dependency </strong>field, if applicable.</li>
            <p class="nugget">Enter an estimated time for the task and when that task is completed, a time entry is added to the ticket and the technician  can add a description of work before saving the time entry. </p>

            <li>Continue to add tasks as needed and click <strong>Save Task</strong> when finished. </li>
