        <p>If your company uses more than one email address for support, you can create multiple mailboxes for each address and assign them to specific customers. Choose which mailbox you want to send responses from when <a href="MSP-Add-Responses-to-Tickets.htm">emailing customers from inside a ticket.</a></p>
