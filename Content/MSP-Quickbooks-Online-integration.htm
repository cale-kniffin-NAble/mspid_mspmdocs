        <h1>Integrate <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> with QuickBooks Online and export your invoices</h1>
        <p>Follow the steps below to set up the integration between your Quickbooks Online and <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> accounts. </p>
        <p class="warning">Disable the pop-up blocker in your browser before getting started.</p>
        <p class="info">With the latest update to <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />'s QuickBooks Online integration, you will need to log in to your QuickBooks Online account prior to exporting invoices to get a token. That token is stored in the <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> database and is valid for the next 100 days. After that time, <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> will require you to log in to QuickBooks again.</p>
        <h3>Configure QuickBooks Online integration with <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" />, navigate to <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Settings</span> &gt; <b>Company Settings</b> &gt; <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Integrations</span> and select <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Configure QuickBooks Online</span>.</li>
            <p class="nugget">Open an additional tab in your browser and log into your QuickBooks Online account. This will allow <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> to easily communicate with QuickBooks. </p>
            <li>Confirm you have disabled your browser's pop-up blocker, and click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Import</span> in the top right corner of the page.</li>
            <li>In the QuickBooks pop-up window, click <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Connect</span> to authorize <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> and QuickBooks to share information. </li>
            <li>
                <p class="info">A status message a the bottom of the page  indicates the connection was successful and also displays the number of customers and services that were successfully imported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>In the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Default Mapping</span> tab, select a default item for each category.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <b>Services</b> tab and use the filters on the left to view specific <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> Item Types (Service Plans, Service Items, Rate Templates or Rates). You can also filter the list of services by <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> Customer or Template, QuickBooks Category or Mapping Status.</li>
            <li>Select an item from the <b>Accounting Service</b> column to map to each <b>MSPM Item</b> in the list. This overrides any default mapping previously configured and allows a specific rate or rate template, for instance, to be mapped directly to an item in QuickBooks. </li>
            <li>&#160;Use the <b>Mapping Status</b> filter to view inactive QuickBooks items, or <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> items that are missing a mapped accounting item or that have been successfully mapped. </li>
            <li>When all items in <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> are successfully mapped to the appropriate accounting items in QuickBooks, navigate to the <b>Default Mapping</b> tab and click <b>Save</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you add products and services to QuickBooks Online, repeat this process to import and map them to the appropriate <MadCap:variable name="MSPManager.ProductName_Long" /> items.</p>
        <h3>Export invoices to QuickBooks Online</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Billing</span> and click <b>+ Add Billing Batch</b>to <a href="MSP-NGP-Run-a-billing-batch.htm">run a billing batch and generate invoices</a>. </li>
            <li>After generating your invoices, select <span class="ButtonMenuNote">QuickBooks Online</span> from the <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Export Format</span> list, and select <span class="ButtonMenuNote">Export Invoices</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your invoices are available instantly in QuickBooks Online after the export is completed.</p>
        <p class="info"><MadCap:variable name="PDFVariables.ProductName" /> does not send customers' billing address and email when exporting invoices to QuickBooks Online. This information should be configured from within the customer's profile in QuickBooks. </p>
